“Advanced Dimension-Reduction Methods and Using  Online Computing for Transparent Research”

Date/Time: January 16, 2024 (onsite and online) 

**Abstract**

Join this half-day workshop on advanced dimension reduction methods (t-SNE and UMAP) and creating interactive Jupyter notebooks.
This workshop will show you how to implement t-SNE and UMAP methods for reducing the number of dimensions in your data and how you can generate and make use of Jupyter notebooks from your R notebooks, and make use of GitHub and Binder to convert them into publicly accessible, interactive notebooks that allow others to reproduce your analysis by the push of a button. By combining Jupyter notebooks with Binder and GitHub, you can enhance transparency, reproducibility, and make use of online computing capabilities, allowing you to easily share and replicate analyses.

Through hands-on exercises and examples, participants will acquire the skills to  
+	Perform t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction  
+	create reproducible Jupyter notebooks from their R notebooks  
+	connect their RStudio projects to GitHub and push the contents of their project folders to GitHub  
+	Use Binder to convert a GitHub repository into interactive, publicly accessible notebooks that other can use to interactively reproduce analyses and even edit and change code to explore the data and analyses.

Note: Basic knowledge of R and familiarity with Jupyter notebooks are recommended. Having a GitHub account is mandatory. Please bring your laptop with RStudio installed, along with relevant linguistic datasets for hands-on exercises.
